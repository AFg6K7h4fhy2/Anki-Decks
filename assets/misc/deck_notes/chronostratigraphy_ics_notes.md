# Notes On Chronostratigraphy ICS

_The following are notes by the author on the creation and possible issues with the deck Chronostratigraphy ICS._

* The deck was originally generated by coaxing ChatGPT-4.0 into interpreting pictures of the chronostratigraphy scale and coming up with particular sets of questions.
* Missing, at present: Questions in the reverse for Ages, Epochs, and Periods, e.g. To which Epoch does the Campanian Age belong?
* Missing, at present: Questions on the creator and derivation history of the units.
* Missing, at present: Questions on the major milestones to have occurred in each unit, built up from the Age/Stage level.
* Units are rounded to the nearest half-integer, except for units less than one million years in age.
